I decided to follow http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/ and try to setup a blog on github which can be used to show code and ipython notebooks.
You can read about the details [here](https://github.com/udibr/pelican)
And here is the result

Code:
{% include_code test.py %}

Notebook:
{% notebook testipynb.ipynb %}
